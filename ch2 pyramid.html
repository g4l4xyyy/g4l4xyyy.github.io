We had woken up early because we had to prepare our equipment. I was anxious; it was a long time since I’d felt like this. I felt like a student who was going on his first excavation. I set off around seven. The way there seemed longer than usual. Maybe it was nerves or anxiety. I could see Mache next to me, she might have been silent but she definitely felt the same way. As we approached Marathon, we were overcome with awe by all the events that the ancient people had experienced at that particular site. Finally, we had arrived at our destination. We parked our car, took our tools and went to find Isida. There was no one there! The chain was padlocked. We found a spot to sit under a plane tree. The disappointment was evident in our eyes. It was just before eight in the morning. It was unthinkable for me to believe that he had deceived us. Unexpectedly he gave life to my dreams and in a second he took it all back. With both of us feeling disappointed we walked melancholically back towards our transport. A lot could have happened, but you can’t build palaces on sand. Just as I opened the car</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">door, my mobile rang.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">‘Yes?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Where are you heading, Aristides?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Hello, Mr. Avgerinos. You said that you’d be here at</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">eight’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘And I am. It’s precisely eight. Time for me is of great importance and you should know that whatever I say, I do, as you’ll find out in the near future’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">We went back to the archaeological site. Outside there was a small van and equipment was being unloaded for the archaeological excavation. Asterios was there as well. The man was telling the truth all along. We reached the locked gate. He unlocked it and opened the gate to our dreams. The joy in Andromache’s face was indescribable. We immediately began to put up the tents were we were going to work from. It was something we hadn’t expected to happen. We thought that nearly everyone and everything were against us. We had to be prudent with our words throughout the whole mission. It was possible that at any given point some obstacle could appear that would alter the entire course of this excavation. So, every movement we made outside the archaeological site should be meticulous. I had a suspicion that we were being watched, so we didn’t make reports on what was happening. However, the time had come to take out our hand brushes and whisk brooms to clean the surrounding area. Asterios approached me and he said to me smiling:</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘So, this is where we will build our future, Aristides. You’ll see that there are many surprises awaiting us. We’ll have an interesting course together’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Yes, and I hope, Asterios, to discover something that will make us renowned in modern History. Who knows? We might find something. We just need patience’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">The first day we put up our tents. We had to go back to our offices at the University to get some maps of the area and also all the papers from the office with the research we had done. As we reached our old offices, we ran into Andromache’s uncle.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Hello, Niko, how are you?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Hello both of you; how are you?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">His behavior was ironic towards us.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Surely you could have informed me about the change with regards to the University, couldn’t you? How did this come about?’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘We had to take some time off for a short period, as a</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">couple we need this’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: right;">‘It is a mystery how quickly replacements were found. Usually this takes around three to four months until someone comes to fill an empty position. I don’t know how you managed that. And out of curiosity, what are you going to do? Or are you just going to enjoy each other’s company?’ ‘We have been invited to take part in an excavation.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It’s an opportunity to go back out into the field. It’s always nice to find something that has been buried for centuries…’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘And where is the excavation, if I might ask?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘The Dutch archaeological academy invited us today. It was them who managed to find the replacements since they’re able to act quickly’</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Where is the excavation going to take place?’ ‘They haven’t informed us yet’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Andromache’s uncle knew that I was lying to him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I hope our things won’t get lost because we don’t know who Asterios will send’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t worry Mache, I’m sure he has made the right</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">choice’.</p><p style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Entering our office we saw two young people sitting</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in our places. A woman and a man.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: left;">‘Don’t worry, your things have been collected and sorted in these boxes. They will be sent to Aristides’s house’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘We would like to ask you, for as long I and Andromache are away, if you can be fair and objective towards our students’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t you worry about anything! We have read about both of you before we even came here. Mr. Avgerinos has briefed us about exactly what we should do here’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">After reassuring us we decided to leave since it was getting dark.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘Strange things are happening, Aristides. Why didn’t you tell the truth to my uncle?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 35pt;text-align: justify;">‘I don’t know, there are things going on that I can’t fully comprehend. I cannot control them so I don’t know how I should react exactly. Until the picture is clear I will only trust you and Asterios’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘How can you trust him so easily?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You have a point but it’s because of him that we have reached our dream that many others have taken away from us’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Yes, but there’s something peculiar about him,</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">you can’t deny that’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You are right again but he is helping us with our operations which have been meticulously calculated. Only time will be the final judge’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Indeed the scene was blurry and it was because I could not fit all the pieces of the puzzle together. At the beginning of the project my partner’s uncle was very positive about the excavation. From the moment though Asterios contacted me, his behavior changed completely. He became more enigmatic, distant and besides that, he had no reason to tell Andromache that he didn’t trust me. All will be unraveled and what is hidden will soon be revealed. Nevertheless, we decided with Andromache to take it step by step all the way, in our meetings, in our future interviews, in</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">who we trusted because it was certain that this matter would get great publicity. Then again I was wrong. No one pestered us from the press, nor from any other news agency and it surprised me that the whole subject wasn’t made known. It was probably for the best this way because nobody would bother us and distract us.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The scenery at the period when it was built must have been magnificent. Herod Atticus had always made great monuments. He always completed them. He never forgot to put the final touch so his name would stay intact throughout the layers of history. At one time a large pyramid or a temple must have prevailed here. But who destroyed it? Who was it that gave the order? Why don’t the people of modern Greece have the knowledge in order to appreciate the magic of the land in which they live in? Here many events have taken place which changed the course of history. Many epic tales have been written about acts of bravery. Heroism and courage was what prevented the barbarians from conquering our land. Despite this, the people of Greece want to mimic the barbarians. They don’t know how beautiful their land is and their endless history. It might sound like a cliché but it’s the truth that whichever rock you turn over some story or local myth will be hiding underneath it.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The excavation was proceeding at a satisfying rate. My instinct was telling me that we would soon make a discovery. We had to divide up the time and work so we could get things done. So, sometimes I would stay a bit longer at the excavation site so we could get the desirable result faster. Today was one of these days. Fortunately, autumn was mild for now and it allowed us to continue with our work. It had just gone dark and we had already installed the lights which allowed us to continue after nightfall. Andromache approached me looking troubled.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘What happened and you have this look on your face? What’s wrong?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘My uncle wants to come over here to stop us</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">carrying on with the excavation’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I don’t think he has the power to stop us. As long as Asterios is by our side we won’t have a problem. As you remember he told us that the orders come from above. So, we have to believe that we can put our plan into action’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We hadn’t finished having our conversation when</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">her uncle appeared from nowhere.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Stop immediately whatever it is you are doing. You are violating all the laws and ethics of the archaeological Academy’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">you’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Calm down, Nikos, I will explain everything to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘I don’t want you to explain anything to me,</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Aristides. Leave this place and don’t ever bother my niece again. I told her that what she was doing was wrong and that you could go to prison for being here. I will protect her but I will  make  sure  that  you’ll  lose  your  license  as  an archaeologist and your place at the university’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘What is your problem, uncle?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t answer me back, pick up your tools and get out of here. From tomorrow I’ll be in charge of the excavation’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘From tomorrow you can do whatever you like,</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mr. Apostolopoulos. It doesn’t concern me at all’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He turned his head round.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘And who are you, sir?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Let me introduce myself, Asterios Avgerinos, benefactor  and  in  charge  of  this  excavation.  Mr. Apostolopoulos, you should know that you are on private property. This place belongs to the Polikandrioti Institute’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">is…’</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘What are you talking about? You are absurd. This</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Please, don’t say anything else. You haven’t got</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">permission to be here’ Asterios said to him.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘What you are saying is unthinkable; who do you think you are?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">I was stunned with her uncle’s behavior. But what came next was even more bizarre. Two men that belonged to Asterios’s personal security approached and escorted her uncle outside. They even locked the gate, leaving only me, Andromache and Asterios in the area.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t worry about your uncle Andromache! They are not going to hurt him, he just won’t be allowed to enter the premises, only the three of us will be present. Let’s continue with our excavation. Aristides, at what point are you with the dig?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">I was a little suspicious and I didn’t answer.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Listen to me Arisides, I will explain everything to you soon but not now. Like I said, time is of great importance now. We have to move within the time frame. So, just before you came here I came upon a spot that might have something there. Maybe there is something underneath’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Asterios came close to me and grabbed the broom from my hands. He hit the spot, where we were standing, with force. It was hollow underneath. So, he let the broom slip from his hands and took a pickaxe and broke the wooden floor. I couldn’t believe that we had found a catacomb.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘But how did you know that it was down there?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Andromache went down first. Sometimes she seemed more daring than me. Growing up I had learned to be more cautious with situations and people. As I descended I found a torch. I lit it. We followed Asterios, who led the way.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘How is it you know where we’re going? It’s like you know the place’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Don’t ask questions Arisides’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">The underground passage led to a large crypt. The sight was incredible. We had found a sarcophagus. It was Isida’s. This turns all history upside down. Isida was a goddess.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘Now that we found it what are we going to do? It’s the discovery of the century. We must take it to the lab, where the conditions are right, so we can open the sarcophagus’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘I am so excited. All our efforts have finally led to an important result. I cannot believe it’ Andromache exclaimed.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘You haven’t seen anything yet’ Asterios said jokingly as he approached the sarcophagus so he could open it.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘What are you doing? You shouldn’t.’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">‘Calm  down,  Andromache,  and  open  the sarcophagus’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I was amazed by the sight. It was empty.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">‘Great, we put in all this effort for an empty sarcophagus? I can’t believe it’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">‘What’s this scroll?’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Asterios picked it up.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘Well done Andromache and Aristides’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘What do you mean “well done”? We only found a</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">scroll!’</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘I’m sure it’s worth something but not as much as</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">if we had found a mummy’…</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: left;">Asterios began reading the scroll. It was a plea to Zeus and Chronos. When he finished reading, something</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">inexplicable happened. Daylight filled the crypt. I could not figure out where all this light was coming from.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘Follow me’ Asterios said.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">As we reached some stairs in the passage we found a lever. Asterios pulled it and over the top of us a small opening appeared. Climbing up we were inside an ancient temple. I couldn’t comprehend it. Next to the shrine from where we had ascended, there was a statue of Deucalion.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘What happened? Where are we?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Andromache was dazzled. She didn’t speak. There was no mention in our files of a Founder’s temple, nor has Pausanias ever mentioned it. Undeniably it was there and what we were experiencing couldn’t be a dream. There were a lot of people around and there was an intense energy in the atmosphere. Suddenly, someone came running shouting:</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘We won, Victory’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We wandered around the surrounding area.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Further away there was a temple of Artemis.</p><p style="padding-left: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">‘How can we be here?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">For a moment I thought I was asleep, that I was in a dream. That I would wake up. However, for the first time reality surpassed Morpheus’ world.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘What do you think of the space-time of the ancient world? I know it may seem hard for you to comprehend  but  it’s  real.  Even  though  it  overturns everything  I  know  and  believe,  it  surpasses  all  my expectations’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">‘How did you know what we had to do, Asterios?’</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘All will be revealed in this journey, my friends. Together we’ll have the chance to discover but also to change the course of history for the better’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘What are you implying, Asterios, what are we going to do?’</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">‘We are going to save Greece from the enemies who either want to steal its glory or they want to destroy it because they can’t understand it’.</p><p style="padding-left: 62pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">‘So what? Are we going to be the guardians of the</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">nation?’ purpose’.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘We have to seek the ideal Greece. This is our</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">‘It’s very dangerous. We don’t know what could</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">happen, Asterios’.</p><p style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 47pt;text-align: justify;">Listen to me, a lot could happen but we have to find the perfect moment of our nation, Aristides.
